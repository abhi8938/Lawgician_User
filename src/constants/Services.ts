         Title1:'Exact. Accredited. Affordable.',
         Para1:`Launched on July 1 2017, the Goods & Services Tax (GST) applies to all Indian service providers (including freelancers), traders and manufacturers. The GST is an all-in-one tax that subsumes a variety of state (VAT, Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, Octroi) and central taxes (CST, Service Tax, Excise Duty). GST is to be charged at every step of the supply chain, with full set-off benefits available. The procedure for GST is entirely online and requires no manual intervention.

     GST is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every value addition. Every product goes through multiple stages along the supply chain, which includes the purchasing of raw materials, manufacturing, sale to the wholesaler, selling to the retailer and then the final sale to the consumer. GST will be levied on each of these stages (including value addition) and at the point of consumption, rather than the origin of the product. For example, if the product is produced in Tamil Nadu but consumed in Karnataka, then the entire tax revenue will go to Karnataka instead of Tamil Nadu. Also, taxpayers with a turnover of less than Rs.1.5 crore can opt for composition scheme to get rid of tedious GST formalities and pay GST at a fixed rate of turnover.`,

         Title1:`Get It Right. The First Time.`,
         Para1:`A trademark can be defined as the unique identity that makes your product or service stand out from the rest. The unique identity or expression can be a logo, photograph, slogan, word, sound, smell, colour combination or graphics. Most of the businesses usually look for registration of logo or name only. If you have come up with a unique idea or logo, then the only way to protect it as your own unique identity is to patent it. A registered trademark is your business’s intellectual property or intangible asset. It acts as a protective cover of the company’s investment made in the logo or brand.

         In India, trademarks are registered by the Controller General Of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, Ministry Of Industry and Commerce, Government Of India. You can register the trademark under the act named, The Trademark Act, 1999. The registration provides the right to sue against others who try to copy your trademark. Also, no one else can use a similar trademark to the one registered by another person. Once you register a trademark, you can use an R symbol along with it, and it will be valid till 10 years from the date of registration. You can easily get a ™ within 3 days. But, to get an ®, it takes up to 2 years. In case the trademark registration is nearing expiry date, you can always get it re-registered for another ten years.`,
         Title2:`What can you Trademark? Who can all apply for Trademark?`,
         Para2:`According to the trademark rules of India, items like sound, logo, words, phrases, colours, images, symbols, initials or a combination of all these can be trademarked. All of these should be made use to make your business stand out from the rest. A trademark application can be done by private firms, individuals, companies, LLP’s, or NGO’s. In the case of NGOs, LLP’s or companies, the trademark has to be applied for registration in the name of the concerned business.`
